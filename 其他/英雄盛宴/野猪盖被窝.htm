<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>野猪盖被窝 Hogs in Bedrolls</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>Few things put a spring in a halfling's step quite like 
the buttery-sausage scent of freshly baked hogs in bedrolls wafting through the 
village. As curious as they are resourceful, halflings have a knack for creating 
new culinary combinations of things they love to eat―in this case, savory 
sausages and flaky pastries. Diminutive, smoked pork-and-beef bangers are snugly 
rolled up into salty dough "bedrolls" until only their "heads" are poking out. 
The expert maneuver is to brush these little snacks with a thin egg wash before 
popping them in the oven, ensuring a glossy shine and a boost of color. And 
slathering them with butter once they are cooked is a truly tasty touch. Hogs in 
bedrolls might just be the perfect finger food for any size halfling 
gathering.</P>

  puff pastry (see Cook's Note), thawed according to package directions<BR>1 
  (12-ounce) package cocktail franks<BR>1 egg<BR>Ketchup, mustard, barbecue 
  sauce, or steak sauce for dipping (optional)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two large rimmed baking 
sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.<BR>On a lightly 
floured work surface, unfold or unroll the puff pastry. If necessary, use a 
rolling pin to gently roll it flat (take care not to press too hard, which 
compresses the layers, decreasing its puff when baked). Cut as many 2-inch 
squares as you have cocktail franks. Lay each frank diagonally on a square, fold 
the two opposite corners up and over the frank to meet at the top, and press or 
pinch them to adhere. Arrange them about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking 
sheets.</P>
<P>In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water 
and brush the top and sides of each bedroll with the mixture. Bake until the 
bedrolls are browned, puffed, and crisp, about 17 minutes, rotating the sheets 
180 degrees and switching racks halfway through baking. Set the baking sheets on 
wire racks and let the bedrolls cool for about 5 minutes. Serve hot, with 
ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce on the side for dipping (if 
desired).</P>

differ, but most include two sheets.<BR>Many cocktail franks measure about 1 1/2 inches 
in length. If yours differ, adjust the size of your puff pastry squares accordingly, 
keeping them about 1/2 inch longer and wider than the franks. If you 
can't find cocktail franks, buy the most slender hot dogs you can and cut them 
into 1 1/2-inch lengths. If the hot dogs are fatter than cocktail franks, 
though, you may have to adjust the size of your puff 
squares.</FONT></SPAN></P></div></body>
