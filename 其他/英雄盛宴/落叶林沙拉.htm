<P>（翻译暂缺）</P>
<P>Located along the northern border of the former halfling 
nation of Luiren was the Lluirwood of southeast Faer?n. Sometimes called "the 
Longforest," due to its lengthy expanse, this dense woodland was the native 
homeland of three groups of halfling who once foraged the thick foliage in 
search of delectable forest treats. After the Hin Ghostwars, the Lluirwood was 
mostly abandoned by halflings and subsequently inhabited by ill-tempered 
monsters that wandered in from the Toadsquat Mountains to the north. But even 
after generations, hungry hin from the coastal cities of Luiren still craved 
those tasty forest flavors and paid adventurers handsomely to extract its 
ingredients. Prior to the Spellplague, which submerged all of Luiren, this sweet 
and savory salad, made up of whole-leaf spinach, dried cranberries, candied 
pecans, and spring cheese, topped with a tangy vinaigrette dressing, would 
anchor the menus of taverns from Beluir to Shoun―a perfect starter to first or 
second evenfeast.</P>
