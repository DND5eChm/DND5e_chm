<P>Miraculous relics fill the tales of Theros. Among these 
legendary items, none are more renowned than the weapons of the gods themselves. 
These artifacts embody divine will and the power of Nyx. Where they appear, 
these weapons change the tide of wars and the course of history.</P>
<P>Typically a deity bestows their weapon only on a favored 
champion or devotee. Depending on the champion's piety score, the mortal can tap 
into hidden properties of the weapon (see chapter 2 for details on piety). 
Alternatively, those who don't worship the weapon's divine owner often find 
themselves cursed for their lack of proper devotion.</P>
<P>Occasionally a god's weapon might fall into the wrong 
hands or go missing entirely, sparking fantastic quests. Consult the Weapons of 
the Gods Adventures table for suggestions of the sort of quests these artifacts 
might inspire.</P>
