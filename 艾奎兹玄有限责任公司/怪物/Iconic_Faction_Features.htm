<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>Iconic Faction Features</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>£¨ÎÞÈË·­Òë£©</P>
<P>An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign frequently pits 
the characters against rival franchises and enemy factions. This section 
provides iconic features that can be added to any monster or NPC stat block to 
make that stat block representative of a specific faction, allowing employees of 
organizations such as Dran Enterprises or the Six to show off specific training 
or tactics endemic to those organizations.</P>
<P>Not all monsters or NPCs in the employ of a faction need 
to have faction features. Lower-ranked members of an organization might have 
only one iconic feature, with that feature replacing some other aspect of their 
stat block. Faction leaders and specialist field operatives might have all the 
iconic features, in addition to the regular features of their stat block. Each 
set of iconic faction features comes with a list of NPCs that work well as 
members of that faction, but those are only suggestions.</P>
<P>Many faction features increase the relative challenge of 
a creature, and thus can increase the threat level of an encounter. Be 
especially aware of this if you add faction features to multiple foes in a 
combat encounter, and think about decreasing the number of foes to keep the 
encounter balanced.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Iconic Dran Enterprises 
Employee</FONT></STRONG><BR>The iconic employee of Dran Enterprises has two 
goals over and above all others: serve Dran Enterprises loyally, and prove the 
superiority of Dran Enterprises over Acquisitions Incorporated. Enemy franchises 
are to be undermined, defeated, and acquired at any cost.</P>
<P>Recommended NPCs: Bandit captain, guard, veteran 
(Monster Manual); bard, swashbuckler, transmuter, warlock of the archfey (Volo's 
Guide to Monsters)</P>
<P>Corporate Focus. The creature has advantage on saving 
throws against being charmed, and has advantage on Wisdom or Charisma checks 
made as part of a contest.<BR>Freeze Assets (1/Day). The next time this creature 
hits with an attack, it can use a bonus action to cause the target of the attack 
to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is 
paralyzed until the start of its next turn.<BR>Hostile Takeover (1/Day). When a 
visible attacker within 15 feet of this creature makes an attack roll, this 
creature uses its reaction to force the attacker to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving 
throw. Unless the save succeeds, this creature forces the attack roll to be 
rerolled against a different target of its choice (other than the attacker) that 
is within the attack's range.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Iconic Noble Knife 
Agent</FONT></STRONG><BR>The iconic Noble Knife agent sees Acquisitions 
Incorporated as just another power-hungry group inevitably getting in the way of 
their own order's principled stand against tyranny. And maybe a few of the 
higher-ups in Acq Inc need to be looked at a little more closely in that 
regard.</P>
<P>Recommended NPCs: Acolyte, mage, spy, thug (Monster 
Manual); archer, enchanter, swashbuckler (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<BR>Noble 
Strike (1/Day). The next time this creature hits with an attack, it can use a 
bonus action to cause the target of the attack to become frightened. An affected 
target can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<BR>Ready to Fight. This 
creature has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is 
surprised.<BR>Reality Slip (1/Day). As a reaction when this creature is hit by 
an attack, it can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, 
then can make one melee weapon attack.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Iconic Zealot of the Silver 
Sliver</FONT></STRONG><BR>The iconic zealot of the Silver Sliver is guided by a 
desire for justice and good, but appears to have no grasp of business or market 
forces. Zealots hide behind their masks as they carry out their pro bono 
heroics, and chastise other hard-working adventurers at every opportunity.</P>
<P>Recommended NPCs: Berserker, knight, priest (Monster 
Manual); diviner, war priest (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<BR>Touch of the Mask 
(1/Day). As an action, this creature thrusts a mask into the face of another 
creature within 5 feet of it, forcing that creature to make a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failure, the target is stunned until the end of its next 
turn. A creature that has no face, or whose face is fully covered by a mask or 
helmet, is immune to this effect.<BR>True Believer (1/Day). As a reaction when 
this creature fails a saving throw against being charmed, it can reroll the 
saving throw.<BR>Zealot's Justice (1/Day). As an action, this creature unleashes 
a cacophony of platitudes that can leave others reeling. Each creature of its 
choice within 30 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw or be restrained. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000></FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Iconic Affiliate of the 
Six</FONT></STRONG><BR>The iconic affiliate of the Six aims not to acquire rival 
franchises, but to destroy them completely. Affiliates of the Six love to toy 
with their foes, revealing the full extent of their evil only as they prepare to 
eradicate those foes.</P>
<P>Recommended NPCs: Bandit captain, berserker, cultist, 
cult fanatic (Monster Manual); blackguard, conjurer, illusionist, warlock of the 
great old one (Volo's Guide to Monsters)<BR>Glimpse of the Beyond (1/Day). As an 
action, this creature provides a glimpse into its true nature by extolling the 
madness of the Far Realm. Each creature within 30 feet of this creature that can 
see and hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be blinded. 
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<BR>Something Feels Off (1/Day). 
When a visible attacker within 5 feet of this creature makes an attack roll 
against it, it can use its reaction to unleash a pulse of distracting 
otherworldly power, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.<BR>Touch of 
Madness. This creature has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or 
frightened.</P></body>
