<P>The Hero's Journey Boon System is a mechanical tool for 
GM's to use as a reward for character development and great roleplaying. It 
reminds both the GM and the players to pay attention to those iconic moments 
when a critical choice transforms a character's development toward or away from 
a certain personality trait or archetype.</P>
<P>To symbolize this change in a character's development 
over the course of an adventure, a Hero's Boon gives a mechanical bonus that 
allows a GM to mark that character's moment of transformation in a palpable 
way.</P>
