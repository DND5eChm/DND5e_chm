<H2>Hazards of the Shadow Realm£¨·­ÒëÔÝÈ±£©</H2>
<P>While most of the realm is ordinary earth and forests, several elements of 
the Shadow Realm are unique to it¡ªor at least far more common than elsewhere. 
These hazards and landmarks are described below.</P>
<P>Doomsand. Similar in most ways to standard quicksand, doomsand follows the 
same rules for sinking and escaping. This ashen-gray slurry is infused with the 
nature of shadow, and it drains the resolve from those in its grasp. A creature 
that starts its turn in doomsand must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or 
become despondent (see Shadow Corruption below). When the creature finishes a 
long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. 
Doomsand usually appears in marshes and swamps, or in deserts as fine dust.</P>
<P>Ebon Tides. Ebon tides are enormous waves of shadow mire, of crackling shadow 
matter¡ªa temporary wave of arcane power pulsing through a region and unmaking 
the land. When they affect a region, use the effects of the ebon tide spell (see 
Chapter 4).</P>
<P>Hungry Gloom. Some areas of the Shadow Realm¡ªor places in the mortal world 
where the barrier to the Shadow Realm is thin¡ªdevelop hungry gloom. An area of 
hungry gloom appears particularly dark and grim, swallowing light. An area of 
light that overlaps hungry gloom has its illumination reduced by one step 
(bright light becomes dim, dim light becomes darkness). Darkvision can't improve 
the ambient light conditions in the area. Shadow-touched creatures (see Shadow 
Corruption below) can see in hungry gloom as if it were bright light.</P>
<P>Leaden Clouds. These dark, heavy clouds oppress the spirit of those beneath 
them, serving as a sort of psychic weight. Creatures under a leaden cloud of 
sorrow must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom or Charisma saving throw to make an 
attack, cast a spell, or move at more than a standard walking pace (though they 
can still defend themselves normally). Certain items, such as emerald goblets 
(see Chapter 10), and spells, such as aid, calm emotions, enthrall, and lesser 
restoration, and even a barbarian's Rage ability negate the effects of leaden 
clouds.</P>
<P>Radiant Wells. This form of well resembles a beacon of light at the surface, 
though it swallows up anything thrown into it. A radiant well is a planar link 
to one of the celestial planes, and it sheds searing, bright daylight in a 
60-foot radius around itself and up into the clouds. This makes them excellent 
landmarks for navigation, though their position can be shifted by ebon tides and 
terrain manipulation. Any creature entering a radiant well falls for 1 round and 
then is ejected upward at relatively high speed from another well within 2d20 
miles (for evil creatures, this increases to 1d100 miles). The force of being 
ejected from the well propels a Small or smaller creature up about 30 feet 
before falling to the ground beside the well (potentially taking normal falling 
damage). Medium and Large creatures are pushed up about 15 feet, and Huge or 
larger creatures simply land at the edge of the well.</P>
<P>Particularly large or active radiant wells sometimes inflict radiant damage 
on evil-aligned creatures. These more active wells are sometimes used as nodes 
or portals to celestial planes by fey wizards and clerics.</P>
<P>Shadow Mire. Usually found along the shores of ponds, lakes, and streams, 
shadow mire is a concentration of pure shadow matter that has eaten away the 
soil, roots, and plants of a place and replaced them with a thin layer of 
viscous purple-black gloop. This resembles dark water and is indistinguishable 
from water at night¡ªleaves and reeds may float on it, and it reflects moonlight 
normally. However, stepping into shadow mire generates an immediate, oversized 
wave that radiates from the creature entering the mire, knocking down all in its 
path. Any creatures within 30 feet, which are smaller than the creature stepping 
into the mire, must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) saving throw or be knocked prone by the wave.</P>
<P>The creature in the center of the mire will be covered by the shadow mire as 
it rolls back to its point of origin, like the splash of an enormous raindrop. 
The creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and 
unconscious.</P>
<P>Some wizards can distill or conjure pits of shadow mire (see spells in 
Chapter 4 and magic items in Chapter 10) and thus reshape a riverbed or 
undermine a bridge, for instance.</P>
<P>Witchlights and Will-o'-Wisps. The Shadow Realm is filled with lesser lights 
than that of the moons and stars, wandering along with typically inscrutable 
aims. A white glow shines in the distance, offering a path or a sign of 
habitation¡ªor simply zipping through the deep woods. These are the tiny 
witchlights (see Tome of Beasts 1) and the larger will-o'-wisps, both of which 
create their own light. The witchlights are tiny shards of crystal, constructed 
creatures believed to have been made as friends, servants, and companions to the 
Ancients of shadow. Only relatively powerful wizards know how to make them, but 
many roam the Shadow Realm on their own.</P>
<P>Witchlights pursue their own purposes: guarding dangerous sites, helping 
travelers, seeking out old runestones, or gathering at certain seasons to dance 
and blink in unison. Others tag along with strangers for hours, perhaps driven 
by curiosity. Their appearance is well known, but their goals are often quite 
obscure. Some are friendly while others guide travelers astray, and a few of 
them serve as familiars to wizards and sorcerers among the shadow fey and shadow 
goblins.</P>
<P>Will-o'-wisps, their larger cousins, are generally malign and capable of more 
damage in combat. They lead travelers into doomsand or shadow mire and even use 
their attacks to sever boat lines or rope bridges.</P>
