<H2>Magic Items and Trickery（翻译暂缺）</H2>
<P>The Shadow Realm is known as a place where magic items, magic tricks, and the 
peculiar memory philters and illusion seeds are common. Other magical items 
found in the Shadow Realm are focused on navigating or surviving the dangers of 
the plane or are derived from the traditions of its goblin, fey, bearfolk, and 
human inhabitants.</P>
