<P>£¨·­ÒëÔÝÈ±£©</P>
<P>Some players and DMs have a knack for coming up with 
character names on the fly, while others find that task more of a challenge. The 
tables in this appendix are designed to make life easier for both kinds of 
people, whether you're naming a player character, a nonplayer character, a 
monster, or even a place.</P>
<P>Each table contains names that are associated with a 
nonhuman character race in the player's handbook or a real-world ethnic or 
language group, with a focus on groups from antiquity and the Middle Ages. You 
can select from the possibilities here, or use dice to determine a name.</P>
<P>Even though names are associated with races in this 
appendix, a character might not have a name from their own race. For instance, a 
half-orc might have grown up among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM, 
you might decide that dragonborn in your campaign have a culture reminiscent of 
ancient Rome and therefore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn names 
suggested here.</P></body>
