<P>（没人翻译）</P>
<P>Coordinating a regular schedule of D&amp;D game sessions, 
to keep a campaign active and vibrant, can be a challenge. If the campaign's 
only Dungeon Master or enough players aren't available, the next session might 
have to be postponed, and repeated problems of this sort can endanger the 
continuation of the campaign.</P>
<P>In short: in a world filled with distractions, it can be 
hard to keep a campaign going. Enter the concept of the shared campaign.</P>
<P>In a shared campaign, more than one member of the group 
can take on the role of DM. A shared campaign is episodic rather than 
continuous, with each play session comprising a complete adventure.</P>
<P>The largest shared campaigns are administered by the 
D&amp;D Adventurers League and overseen by Wizards of the Coast. You can also 
create your own shared campaign for a school D&amp;D club, at a game store, a 
library, or anywhere else where D&amp;D players and DMs gather.</P>
<P>A shared campaign establishes a framework that allows a 
player to take a character from one DM's game to another one within the shared 
campaign. It creates a situation where almost nothing can prevent a scheduled 
session from happening. The roster of potential players can be quite large, 
virtually ensuring that any session has at least the minimum number of 
characters needed to play. If everyone shows up to play at the same time, 
multiple DMs ensure that everyone can take part.</P>
<P>In order to be successful, a shared campaign needs a 
champion-someone who takes on the responsibility of organizing and maintaining 
the group. If you're interested in learning more about how to run a shared 
campaign and seeing how the Adventurers League handles certain issues, then the 
rest of this appendix is meant for you.</P>

<P><STRONG>Code of Conduct<BR></STRONG>Time and time 
  again, the core rulebooks come back to the point that the most important goal 
  of a D&amp;D play session is for everyone involved to have fun. In keeping 
  with that goal, it's a good idea for a shared campaign to have a code of 
  conduct. Because people who don't normally play together might end up at the 
  same table in a shared campaign, it can be helpful to establish some ground 
  rules for          
          
              
            
       behavior.</P>
<P>          
          
              
            
       On the broadest level, everyone in a shared campaign is 
  responsible for making sure that everyone else has an enjoyable time. If 
  anyone feels offended, belittled, or bullied by the actions of another person, 
  the entire purpose of getting together to play is          
          
              
            
       defeated.</P>
<P>          
          
              
            
       The basic code of conduct for a shared campaign might 
  be modeled on a similar document that another organization or location uses. 
  Beyond that, some special policies might need to be added to account for what 
  might happen at the table when players and DMs interact. As a starting point, 
  consider the following material, which is excerpted from the Adventurers 
  League code of          
          
              
            
       conduct.</P>
<P>          
          
              
            
       During a play session, participants are expected          
          
              
            
       to:</P>
<P>          
          
              
            
       Follow the DM's lead and refrain from arguing with the 
  DM or other players over rules.<BR>Let other players speak, and allow other 
  players to get attention from the DM.<BR>Avoid excessive conversation that is 
  not relevant to the adventure.<BR>Discourage others from using social media to 
  bully, shame, or intimidate other participants.<BR>Make the DM or the 
  campaign's administrators aware of disruptive or aggressive behavior so that 
  appropriate action can be          
          
              
            
       taken.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></body>
