<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000 size=5>角色提升 Character Advancement</FONT></STRONG><BR>In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not by 
accumulating experience points but by reaching experience checkpoints. This 
system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play 
session.</P>
<P>A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an 
adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is based on the adventure's 
projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table. The 
reward for completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 2 
checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours playing through it.</P>
<P>If a character completes an adventure designed for a 
tier higher than the character's current tier, the character is awarded 1 
additional checkpoint. For example, if a 2nd-level character completes a 
6th-level adventure designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 
checkpoints.</P>
<P>Playing time might seem like an odd way to measure 
experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with how a shared campaign is 
meant to work. A character played for 10 hours reaches the same number of 
checkpoints, whether the character went up against a dragon or spent all that 
time lurking in a pub. This approach ensures that a player's preferred style is 
neither penalized nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and 
social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to 
avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.</P>

使用记录点 Using Checkpoints
</FONT></STRONG>
<BR>
The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level 
depends on a character's level:</P>
<P>At levels 1C4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to 
advance to the next level.
<BR >
 At level 5 or higher, 
reaching 8 checkpoints is needed to advance to the next level.
<BR >
  At the end of a play session, characters must level up if 
they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The required number of 
checkpoints is expended, and any remaining checkpoints are applied toward the 
next opportunity for advancement.</P></body>
