<P>（没人翻译）</P>
<P>Designing adventures for a shared campaign involves a 
different set of considerations than designing for a standard group of players. 
Most important, the adventure must be timed to conclude when the session is 
scheduled to end. You also need to balance combat encounters for a range of 
levels, since a wide range of characters might be experiencing the adventure at 
the same time.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Adventure 
Duration</FONT></STRONG><BR>Every adventure in a shared campaign begins and ends 
in the same play session. (If a group of participants wants to take longer to 
finish and all are willing to do so, they can exceed the time limit.) A session 
or an event can't end with the adventure unfinished, since there's no way to 
guarantee that the same players and DM will be available for the next 
session.</P>
<P>Typically, adventures in a shared campaign are designed 
to take either 2 hours or 4 hours. In each hour of play, assume the characters 
can complete the following:</P>
<P>Three or four simple combat encounters, or one or two 
complex ones<BR>Three or four scenes involving significant exploration or social 
interaction<BR>Within these constraints, it can be difficult to create 
open-ended adventures. A time limit assumes a specific starting point and 
endpoint. A good way to get around this restriction is to create an adventure 
with multiple possible endings.</P>
<P>Location-based adventures also work well with this 
format. A dungeon presents a natural limit on character options, while still 
giving the players choices. The adventure could be a quest to defeat a creature 
or recover an item, but the path to achieving that goal can be different for 
each group.</P>
<P>For more narrative adventures, try to focus on simple but 
flexible encounters or events. For instance, an adventure requires the 
characters to protect a high priest of Tyr from assassins. Give the players a 
chance to plan out how they want to protect the temple, complete with authority 
over the guards. A few well-fleshed out NPCs, some of whom might be suspected of 
working with the temple's enemies, add a layer of tension. Consider leaving some 
details or plot points for the DM to decide. For example, the DM might have the 
option to pick which member of the temple guards is the traitor, ensuring that 
the scenario is different for each group.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Combat 
Encounters<BR></FONT></STRONG>Design your adventure for one of the four tiers, 
as set forth in chapter 1 of the player's handbook: tier 1 includes levels 1-4, 
tier 2 is levels 5-10, tier 3 is levels 11-16, and tier 4 includes levels 17-20. 
Within each tier, it's a good idea to use a specific level as a starting point. 
Assume a party of five 3rd-level characters for tier 1, five 8th-level 
characters for tier 2, five 13th-level characters for tier 3, and five 
18th-level characters for tier 4. Use that assumption when creating combat 
encounters, whether you use the encounter-building rules in the dungeon master's 
guide or are making an estimate.</P>
<P>For each battle, provide guidelines to help DMs adjust 
the difficulty up or down to match stronger or weaker parties. As a rule of 
thumb, account for a party two levels higher and for a party two levels lower, 
and don't worry about balancing the adventure for parties outside the 
adventure's tier.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#800000>Rewards</FONT></STRONG><BR>Adventures in a shared campaign that 
uses variant rules for gaining levels and acquiring treasure (such as those 
described below) don't include experience point awards or specific amounts and 
kinds of treasure.</P></body>
